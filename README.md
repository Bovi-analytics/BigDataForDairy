## Master in Veterinary Medicine

### Dairy Herd analytics

Interpretation of production, reproduction records

### Nutritional management
Information and tools to assist in managing dairy nutrition, including resources on forages, pasture, heifers, and calves.
### Transition Management
The transition feeding phase can be defined by several different time periods. In this paper, the transition time period includes the close up dry cow (three weeks before calving) through the fresh cow time period (two weeks after calving). A successful feeding system and strategy delivers the needed nutrients to each cow to meet her requirements. 
### Reproduction and Genetics
Topics covered include heat detection, artificial insemination (AI), breeding program strategies, management aids, infertility, calving management, dairy genetics, and economic analysis.
