## Finding your way around
This repository contains:
- **1 introductory slidedeck** ([`index.html`](https://github.com/RubenVerborgh/WebFundamentals/blob/gh-pages/index.html) in the [root folder](https://github.com/RubenVerborgh/WebFundamentals/))
- **5 lecture slidedecks** (`index.html` files in subfolders such as [`architecture`](https://github.com/RubenVerborgh/WebFundamentals/tree/gh-pages/architecture))
- **shared [`images`](https://github.com/RubenVerborgh/WebFundamentals/tree/gh-pages/_shared/images), [`styles`](https://github.com/RubenVerborgh/WebFundamentals/tree/gh-pages/_shared/styles), [`fonts`](https://github.com/RubenVerborgh/WebFundamentals/tree/gh-pages/_shared/fonts), and [`scripts`](https://github.com/RubenVerborgh/WebFundamentals/tree/gh-pages/_shared/scripts)**
- **`images` per lecture** (`images` folders in subfolders such as [`architecture`](https://github.com/RubenVerborgh/WebFundamentals/tree/gh-pages/architecture))
- **auxiliary files** in the [root folder](https://github.com/RubenVerborgh/WebFundamentals/)

## How to start
A typical starting point would be to open up any `index.html` file, either in the root folder or any of the subfolders. This allows you to edit the contents of the corresponding slidedeck.

The slides themselves are regular HTML files, brought to life with the [Shower](https://github.com/shower/shower) presentation engine. They use the [Clear](https://github.com/RubenVerborgh/Shower-Clear) template with a few customizations in [`_shared/styles/web-fundamentals.css`](https://github.com/RubenVerborgh/WebFundamentals/blob/gh-pages/_shared/styles/web-fundamentals.css).

You can just open the slides in you browser. from the local filesystem while editing. Alternatively, you can install [gulp](http://gulpjs.com/) and run the `gulp` command in the root folder, which will autorefresh your browser upon changes.
